**Timothy Zakian** assignment submission for a15/final submission for compilers!!. Everything works to the best of my
knowledge

* All optimizations can be found in Compiler/Optimizations
* Test-case can be found in this directory
* **The wrappers have been changed** for this (to allow for the various wrappers required by the optimizations)
* the optimizations that I have done are the following:
  - Optimize-self-reference
  - Optimize-source
